# nb_plyprc
a norns classic as nb player

----

polyperc as you know it.

but this time limited to 6 voices to keep your precious CPU for other things and the addition of a mod section to make use of the mod-parameter of nb players. Not many scripts have it implemented (yet) but sidvagn does. The mod-depth can also be controlled via param, so perfect for midi-mapping too. If you have `fx mod` installed and activated you can send (and modulate) to fx of your choice.

Install and activate like all nb players.

happy percin'
